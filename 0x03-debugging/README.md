 Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in the source code of any software. When software does not work as expected, computer programmers study the code to determine why any errors occurred.
 Isolate the source of the bug. Identify the cause of the bug. Determine a fix for the bug. Apply the fix and test it.
